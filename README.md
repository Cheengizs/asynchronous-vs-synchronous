# Difference between asynchronous and synchronous code

### Synchronous code completed sequentially, as time as asynchronous code completes parallel.
### To create asynchronous code you should create method with keyword async in signature and using keyword await in method body to methods, that return Task

### If to talk about my program, code completes sequentially in the first half and asynchronously in the second. "async" methods start at the same time.
